These cases support practitioners of systems engineering and are also used in the
academic instruction in systems engineering within military service academies and at both
civilian and military graduate schools. Each of the case studies comprises elements of success as
well as examples of systems engineering decisions that, in hindsight, were not optimal. Both
types of examples are useful for learning. Plans exist for future case studies focusing on various
space systems, additional aircraft programs, munitions programs, joint service programs,
logistics-led programs, science and technology/laboratory efforts, and a variety of commercial
systems.
